- get OCR working faster/more reliably; currently the conversion from PDF to 300dpi TIFF and then running tesseract on the result takes about 6.8s per page.

- make DocumentCloud optional -- you should be able to just use the tool to split up the PDF and build you a directory 
  of filtered PDFs and their metadata files

- auto-detection so you don't need user-specified options
   - right/left justification of headers
   - scanned PDFs
   - PDF portfolios 

- cleanup of tmp directories; both the mailshredder ones and the ones used for convert/tesseract; these currently
  build up indefinitely
  /var/folders/ts/2byct4k90h5fcwcl8bn3pht40000gn/T/mailshredder and /var/folders/ts/2byct4k90h5fcwcl8bn3pht40000gn/T on my mac)

- filter options:
  - undo selection change (in case you accidentally hit "select all" after painstakingly selecting lots of
    individual emails)
  - make "select all" and "select none" respect the current filter  
  - force table to show "all" -- tried this, but it breaks the layout

- support for other input types:
  - pst

- MonolithicPdfReader: allow control of numNonHeadersAllowedAtTop (would we encounter email tranches with
  a multi-line "masthead" at the top of each page? we currently allow for a single line at the top; the more you
  allow, the bigger the chance you're going to get a false positive where an embedded email gets recognized
  as the start of a new email -- imagine a 3 page email, where on page 3, you have two lines of text and then
  a set of headers from an embedded email)

- concept of a "project" -- let you re-open an existing project and manipulate the selection and re-export

- upload error handling so you can retry failed uploads -- very important for large document sets

- MultiplePdfReader - handle documents with no email at all (like some random text docs that got thrown into the mix)

- parallel uploads to DocumentCloud for speed (although speed doesn't seem like a big problem with DC)

- saving credentials for convenience

- case insensitivity when parsing out headers?

- report: maybe output senders by pages of email as well as just numbers of messages

- report: how to make it super easy to open the TXT files in a spreadsheet?

- handle situation where embedded email headers start at the top of the page (somehow identify that these are not starting a new email)
