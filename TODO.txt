- case insensitivity when parsing out headers?

- maybe output senders by pages of email as well as just numbers of messages

- how to make it super easy to open the TXT files in a spreadsheet?

- how to cluster subject lines for easy filtering?

- better management of output directory (should we just automatically
  create some temporary location for the parsed files, and only write to a user-specified location if the user specifically
  requests it?)

- handle situation where embedded email headers start at the top of the page (somehow identify that these are not starting a new email)

- parallel uploads to DocumentCloud

- upload error handling so you can retry failed uploads -- very important for large document sets

- UI for sorting and filtering; maybe sort by email size, sender frequency, sort by subject line, sort by subject but
  collapse numeric-only differences, e.g. "DNCR media clips for 4-7-2016" and "DNCR media clips for 4-8-2016" could
  be collapsed to "DNCR media clips for " or something.
